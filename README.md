# Portfolio Project

# Overview

For this project you must create the beginnings of a personal portfolio page using **HTML** & **CSS.** Beyond creating a portfolio page, this project will be a good opportunity to practice

- [ ]  Responsive Web Design
- [ ]  Accessibility
- [ ]  Semantic HTML Tags
- [ ]  CSS & HTML

## Why HTML & CSS?

Most portfolio websites are largely single page **static web pages**. In other words, the data that is served is how it is stored. This is in contrast to **dynamic web pages** were user interaction can dictate a change in what is rendered onto the page. 

## Can I use a framework?

The short answer: *you may...*
The reason why you may not want to do this: While you definitely can, you may be over-engineering the problem. Before you implement a frontend framework, determine whether your UI's state is heavily dependent on user driven interaction.

## What's Netlify?
https://www.netlify.com/
Netlify is an open source web hosting tool that makes deploying your projects fast and easy. Typically you will need to give a deployment website some build command however since we are just making an HTML CSS static site, you also will not necessarily need a build tool like web pack

## Node? Express?

Because of the relative simplicity of this project, we do not necessarily need node and express to create a development environment. 

## Basic Requirements

### Set-up

- [ ]  Initialize a new git repository
- [ ]  Clone your newly created repository to your desktop.
- [ ]  Within your application you will need to create both an `index.html` & an `style.css`. Netlify looks for the `index.html` file when searching what file it needs to serve
- [ ]  Include a `readme`
- [ ]  Create an account on netlify.com

### Static Web Page

- [ ]  Use of semantic HTML tagging.
- [ ]  Web page must be responsive.
- [ ]  Choose a color scheme with reasonable contrast

### Deployment

- [ ]  The application can be deployed to a different service if you have time, but as a **minimum** it must be deployed to **Netlify.**

### Presentation

- [ ]  Presentations will be 5 minutes **maximum**. Within this, include:
    - [ ]  Must include a demonstration, include website's responsiveness
    - [ ]  Must include a google slide presentation. Use this as a space to talk about learnings, challenges & anything else unique about your project.
- [ ]  Take time to polish up your slides so that there is consistency between your application and your slides.

### Advanced Requirements
- [ ]  Create a free Figma aacount here: https://www.figma.com/
- [ ]  Create a figma mockup for your UI!
